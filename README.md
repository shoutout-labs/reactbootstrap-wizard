Describe reactbootstrap-wizard here.

Based on https://github.com/creativetimofficial/react-bootstrap-wizard

## why

Original project is based on reactstrap. This is the react bootstrap version with little bit twekes and with progressbar only.

## notes

react-bootstrap does not include in the final package. Need to install it separately when using
